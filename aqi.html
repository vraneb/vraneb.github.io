        <p>In the United States air pollution is measured through the air quality index (AQI), as established by the EPA. It is a measure of the safety of the air in an area. It ranges from 0 to 500, although values above 500 are possible and considered "beyond the AQI".</p>
        <p>The AQI is calculated independently for six pollution types: ozone, particulate matter (<2.5µm), particulate matter (<10µm), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Pollutants are measured over different periods of time from 1 hour to a whole day. The pollutant with the highest index determines the overall AQI.</p>
        <p>The index is grouped into six categories: good (0-50), moderate (51-100), unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150), unhealthy (151-200), very unhealthy (201-300), hazardous (301+).</p>
        <p>Within each category, for each pollutant, the index is linear (if an increase of 5 ppm increases the index by 1, an icrease of 20ppm increases the index by 4). However, it may or may not be linear across the boundaries between health categories.</p>
        <p>Other countries have different measures, and sometimes measure different pollutants as well, such as airborne lead.</p>
