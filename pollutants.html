        <h1>Air Pollutants</h1><hr>
        <p>Human activity has resulted in the release of various types of pollutants into the air we breathe. Many of these have harmful effects on human health and the environment. These are tracked across the globe, but regulations are not present or effective everywhere, leading to massively polluted skylines like those of Delhi, Dhaka, Dammam, Baghdad, and Xi'an.</p>

        <h2 id="ozone">Ozone</h2>
        <p>Ozone is an important compound in the atmosphere that enables life as we know it. It blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can directly harm living cells. However, ozone is very reactive, which makes it hazardous at ground level, instead of high in the atmosphere, where it reacts with organisms and inorganic materials to cause a multitude of problems</p>
        <p>Ozone can cause coughing, inflammation, susceptibility to respiratory illness, and increased asthma attacks, and long term exposure "is likely to be one of many causes of asthma development." It can also hinder the growth of plants, reducing green cover and crop production. Furthermore, ozone accelerates the degredation of many modern synthetics like rubber, paint, polyester, nylon, etc.</p>
        <p>Ground-level ozone is mostly produced as a product of the reaction between nitrogen oxides and certain organic compounds. These oxides come mostly (95%) from human emissions from fossil fuels and other activities. The organic compounds come from volatile substances used in industry such as gasoline, its production, and various solvents and chemicals such as paint thinner. However, a much higher amount (~two thirds) of these organics come from natural sources like forests (this is the "smoke" in the Smoky Mountains!).</p>

        <h2 id="PM">Particulate Matter (PM)</h2>
        <p>Your average strand of hair is about 0.05-0.07 mm across, or 50-70 µm. PM pollution is split into two catergories: PM10 and PM2.5, where 10 and 2.5 are referring to the size (in µm) of the particles. PM is the chemically broadest kind of pollution, a kind of catch-all for solid and liquid airborne pollutants. You can sometimes see PM in the air, particularly PM2.5 as a visibility-reducing haze.</p>
        <p>Like most pollutants, some amount of PM is normal, but human activities have greatly elevated its presence. A major source of PM2.5 is most forms of combustion - wood fires, car engines, coal plants, forest fires, etc. High levels of PM2.5 pollutants swept across north america in summer 2023, coming from Canadian wildfires. The highest consistent levels of PM2.5 are found in dense, impoverished cities such as New Delhi. Reducing PM2.5 pollution is, in part, a social problem. PM10 pollution tends to come more from physical action, like road grime, dust, and stone crushing.</p>
        <p>PM is split into these categories because the smaller a sparticle is, the more likely it is to do harm in the body. The body can, in small amounts, block PM10. It often serves as a physical irritant, while PM2.5 is much harder to block and can quickly enter the bloodstream. However, high concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 both cause serious problems. PM10 exposure is linked to COPD and chronic PM2.5 exposure reduces lung development in children.</p>
