				<p>
					NOx is the general for of various nitrogen-oxygen gasses in
					the atmosphere, the vast majority of which is NO or NO2. NO2
					is used as a general indicaor for NOx in general. Nitrogen
					oxides tend to be reactive, and therefore tend to cause
					problems. Almost all human sources are combustion related,
					especially at high temperatures like in various power
					plants. About half of NOx emmisions come from gasoline cars
					and disel trucks.
				</p>
				<p>
					NO2 is a respiratory irritant, and exacerbates varies
					conditions like asthma. Coughing, wheezing, and difficulty
					breathing are normal symptoms. Long term exposure can cause
					fluid build-up and chronic lung disease. High concentrations
					of NO2 (beyond standard pollution levels) can cause burns,
					spasms, swelling, and (at the extreme) death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Environmentally, NO2 is a large contributor to acid
					deposition (acid rain) via nitric acid as a reaction
					product, can contribute to algal blooms, and can reduce
					visibility in a thin haze. Acid rain affects many synthetic
					materials, and can cause discoloration and material
					weakness. It can also disrupt fragile ecosystems where soil
					and plants are particularly sensitive to pH changes. In
					aquatic ecosystems, components of various NOx contribute
					nitrates to algal blooms.
