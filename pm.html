					Your average strand of hair is about 0.05-0.07 mm across, or
					50-70 µm. Particulate matter is mostly smaller than that,
					and is usually split into two catergories based on size:
					PM10 and PM2.5, where 10 and 2.5 are referring to the size
					(in µm) of the particles. Sometimes, a third category, DPM,
					is used to indicated PM from disel engines, which is usually
					&lt;1µm, and otherwise included in PM2.5. PM is the
					chemically broadest kind of pollution, a kind of catch-all
					for solid and liquid airborne pollutants. You can sometimes
					see PM in the air, particularly PM2.5 as a
					visibility-reducing haze.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like most pollutants, some amount of PM is normal, but human
					activities have greatly elevated its presence. A major
					source of PM2.5 is most forms of combustion - wood fires,
					car engines, coal plants, forest fires, etc. High levels of
					PM2.5 pollutants swept across north america in summer 2023,
					coming from Canadian wildfires. The highest consistent
					levels of PM2.5 are found in dense, impoverished cities such
					as New Delhi. Reducing PM2.5 pollution is, in part, a social
					problem. PM10 pollution tends to come more from physical
					action, like road grime, dust, and stone crushing.
				</p>
				<p>
					PM is split into these categories because the smaller a
					sparticle is, the more likely it is to do harm in the body.
					The body can, in small amounts, block PM10. It often serves
					as a physical irritant, while PM2.5 is much harder to block
					and can quickly enter the bloodstream. However, high
					concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 both cause serious
					problems. PM10 exposure is linked to COPD and chronic PM2.5
					exposure reduces lung development in children.
