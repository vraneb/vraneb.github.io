					Different solutions are needed for different air pollutants,
					but we can look to the past for inspiration. We have
					occasionally succeeded in reducing air pollutants when we
					have identified immediate, existential threats to humanity.
				</p>
				<strong>Lead</strong>
				<p>
					From 1920 until 2021, leaded gasoline was widely used for
					its favorable combustion properties. Unfortunately, it also
					spewed out incredible amounts of lead and lead-containing
					compounds into the air for people to breathe. Yes, 2021.
					That was the final end of its use in cars worldwide. Most
					countries banned leaded gas is the 1970s and 1980s, though.
					Airborne lead is down 98% since 1980, with most of that 2%
					coming from leaded aviation fuel and lead refining. When we
					realized that there was no "safe" amount of lead, and that
					leaded gasoline was responsible for deposition of lead
					across the globe, and that it has caused a few trillion
					dollars in health costs, we banned it, and found an
					alternative.
				</p>
				<strong>(Hydro) Chlorofluorocarbons</strong>
				<p>
					(H)CFCs are a type of chemical that is often useful as
					refridgerants, aerosol propellants, and more due to having a
					favorable boiling point. They are extremely potent
					greenhouse gasses and also react with ozone (the helpful
					kind in the stratosphere, not the harmful ground-level
					stuff) to destroy it. In 1974, this effect was discovered to
					be causing a massive hole in the ozone layer over the poles,
					which could cause incredible increases in cancer rates and
					other public health crises. Across the globe, the Montreal
					Protocol was enacted to cease the use of CFCs. Again, we
					found alternative gasses. The ozone layer has been slowly
					healing over the past few decades, but evidence suggests
					unregulated use in China is slowing progress.
				</p>
				<strong>What now?</strong>
				<p>
					One thing environmental pollutant success stories have in
					common is that we found alternative ways to accomplish the
					tasks that produced these pollutants. Thankfully, for many
					of the pollutants documented here, there are
					<em>already</em> effective, economically viable alternatives
					that just need a legislative push to begin the process of
					drastically reduce their emission, or are only limited by
					distribution. Since the threat posed by these pollutants is
					not as impending, we have been dragging our feet, albeit in
					the right direction. But we aren't doing ourselves any
					favors.
