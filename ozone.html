				<p>
					Ozone is an important compound in the atmosphere that
					enables life as we know it. It blocks ultraviolet radiation
					from the sun that can directly harm living cells. However,
					ozone is very reactive, which makes it hazardous at ground
					level, instead of high in the atmosphere, where it reacts
					with organisms and inorganic materials to cause a multitude
					of problems
				</p>
				<p>
					Ozone can cause coughing, inflammation, susceptibility to
					respiratory illness, and increased asthma attacks, and long
					term exposure "is likely to be one of many causes of asthma
					development." It can also hinder the growth of plants,
					reducing green cover and crop production. Furthermore, ozone
					accelerates the degredation of many modern synthetics like
					rubber, paint, polyester, nylon, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ground-level ozone is mostly produced as a product of the
					reaction between nitrogen oxides and certain organic
					compounds. These oxides come mostly (95%) from human
					emissions from fossil fuels and other activities. The
					organic compounds come from volatile substances used in
					industry such as gasoline, its production, and various
					solvents and chemicals such as paint thinner. However, a
					much higher amount (~two thirds) of these organics come from
					natural sources like forests (this is the "smoke" in the
					Smoky Mountains!).
