					The pages for each individual pollutant lists specific
					effects, but there are certain details outlined here that
					apply to all. Firstly is the idea of "vulnerable groups."
					Certain demographics are much more susceptible to air
					pollutants than the average healthy pair of lungs. In
					general, this is just "anyone with lower lung function". If
					a person would have difficulty with aerobic activity, they
					would have trouble with pollutants. Common groups that are
					mentioned are the elderly, children, and those with asthma.
					In children, chronic exposure to pollutants can result in
					impaired lung development and lifelong struggles. These
					groups are advised to stay indoors during times of high
					pollution and to wear masks that are capable of filtering
					particulate matter when outside.
				</p>
				<p>
					Environmentally, we are outpacing the Earth's natural
					capacity to filter the atmosphere. However, it is still
					possible to avert or mitigate many of the grave consequences
					we are facing. See
					<a href="solutions.html">Solutions</a> for a brief overview
					of what we can do.
