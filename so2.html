					Sulfur dioxide is a particularly potent pollutant. Similar to NOx, it really represents a few variations of sulfur oxides, SOx.
					However, unlike nitrogen oxides the proportion of SOx that is SO2 is about 98%, so SO2 is almost exclusively measured as a stand in.
					SO2 is measured independently, but it also contributes notably to PM2.5 pollution.
					Reactions in the atmosphere with SO2 can produce sulfates that can clump into PM2.5 particles, form sulfuric acid rain, and produce sulfate nutrient pollution.
					See <a href="./nox.html">NOx</a> and <a href="./pm.html">PM</a> for details about these secondary pollutants. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Sulfur dioxide tends to come from more industrial sources, like fossil fuel power plants and heavy machinery that burn sulfur-rich fuels.
					Unlike many air pollutants that are colorless and odorless (we tend to avoid using processes that stink when possible), sulfur dioxide has a distinct smell.
					It has been described as the smell of striking a match, although most matches are phosphorus-based.
					Directly, sulfur dioxide causes similar symptoms to NOx. Coughing, difficultly breathing, increased asthma attacks, general irritation.
					Long term exposure can hinder lung development and function.
				</p>
				<p>
					Between the smell and the secondary pollution, more stringent requirements has been placed on SO2 than NOx.
